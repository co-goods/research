# F. Xavier Olleros

## Bio
F. Xavier Olleros is affiliated with ESG-UQAM (École des sciences de la gestion, Université du Québec à Montréal). His research focuses on the economics of digital goods, network effects, and the theoretical foundations of antirival goods in the sharing economy.

## Relevance to Co-Goods
Olleros' work on antirival goods theory is foundational to understanding how co-created physical products might exhibit network effects and increasing returns to adoption. His framework for classifying goods that become more valuable through shared use provides crucial theoretical grounding for the co-goods protocol, particularly when considering how networked physical products could create positive externalities for all participants.

## Notes
Key theoretical contributions include defining antirival goods as orthogonal to traditional rival/nonrival classifications and establishing frameworks for understanding increasing returns to shared use in digital and sharing economy contexts.
