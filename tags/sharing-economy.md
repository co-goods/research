# Sharing Economy

## Description
The sharing economy represents an economic model where individuals share access to assets, services, and resources through digital platforms, often without transferring ownership. This model leverages underutilized capacity and creates value through access rather than possession.

Key characteristics:
- **Asset Utilization**: Maximizes value from underused resources
- **Platform Mediation**: Digital platforms facilitate sharing transactions
- **Access over Ownership**: Focus on use rights rather than ownership rights
- **Peer-to-Peer Exchange**: Direct exchange between individuals

This tag should be used when discussing:
- Platform businesses like Airbnb, Uber, bike-sharing systems
- Collaborative consumption and access-based business models
- Resource optimization and efficiency gains
- Co-goods that enable shared access and utilization

## Notes
The sharing economy provides important precedents for co-goods systems, particularly in demonstrating how shared access can create value and how platforms can coordinate distributed resources effectively.
