# Goods Theory

## Description
Goods theory provides the economic framework for understanding and classifying different types of goods based on their fundamental characteristics. The traditional classification considers rivalry (whether one person's consumption prevents another's) and excludability (whether access can be restricted).

Key classifications:
- **Private Goods**: Rival and excludable (typical market goods)
- **Public Goods**: Non-rival and non-excludable (national defense, lighthouses)
- **Club Goods**: Non-rival but excludable (streaming services, private parks)
- **Common Pool Resources**: Rival but non-excludable (fisheries, atmosphere)

This tag should be used when discussing:
- Theoretical frameworks for understanding goods characteristics
- Classification systems and their limitations
- New or hybrid categories of goods (like antirival goods)
- Co-goods and their place in goods theory taxonomy

## Notes
Traditional goods theory provides the foundation for understanding co-goods, but may need expansion to accommodate new categories like antirival goods that don't fit neatly into existing classifications.
