# Nonrival

## Description
Nonrival goods are characterized by the ability to be consumed or used by multiple people simultaneously without depletion. When one person uses a nonrival good, it doesn't prevent or diminish another person's ability to use it. This is a property of the *units* being shared, distinct from [[antirival|antirivalness]], which is a property of the *system* enabling sharing.

Key characteristics:
- **No Depletion**: One person's use doesn't reduce availability for others
- **Low Marginal Cost**: Cost of sharing approaches zero
- **Copyable**: Can be reproduced without loss of the original
- **Independent Use**: Multiple simultaneous users don't interfere with each other

This tag should be used when discussing:
- Properties of digital goods and information
- Theoretical frameworks for goods classification
- Cost barriers to sharing
- The difference between nonrivalness and [[antirival|antirivalness]]
- Knowledge sharing and open access resources

## Notes
Nonrivalness lowers the *cost* of sharing by enabling distribution without depletion. However, nonrivalness alone doesn't guarantee widespread adoption or value creation - that requires [[antirival]] system design that raises the *benefits* of sharing.

Classic examples include:
- **Digital files**: mp3s, PDFs, software (can be copied infinitely)
- **Knowledge**: sharing doesn't deplete the source
- **Broadcasts**: radio/TV signals reach multiple receivers simultaneously

As [[f-xavier-olleros|Olleros]] demonstrates, an mp3 file is inherently nonrival but only became transformative when embedded in [[antirival]] platforms like Napster. Full inclusiveness requires addressing both low-cost sharing (nonrivalness) AND high-benefit sharing (antirivalness).
