# Commons

## Description
Commons refer to shared resources that are collectively owned, managed, and governed by a community. These resources can be physical (forests, fisheries) or digital (open-source software, knowledge bases), and are characterized by shared stewardship rather than individual ownership.

Key characteristics:
- **Collective Ownership**: Resources belong to the community
- **Shared Governance**: Community-based management and decision-making
- **Common Access**: Members have usage rights based on community rules
- **Stewardship**: Long-term care and sustainability focus

This tag should be used when discussing:
- Traditional commons like forests, grazing lands, water resources
- Digital commons like open-source software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons
- Governance mechanisms for shared resources
- Co-goods that operate as commons or common pool resources

## Notes
The commons tradition provides crucial insights for co-goods governance, particularly around sustainable management of shared resources and collective decision-making processes.
