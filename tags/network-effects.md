# Network Effects

## Description
Network effects occur when the value of a product, service, or platform increases as more users adopt it. This creates a virtuous cycle where early adoption incentivizes further adoption, leading to exponential value creation for all participants.

Key characteristics:
- **Positive Externalities**: Each new user adds value for existing users
- **Increasing Returns**: Value grows faster than linear adoption
- **Network Value**: Total system value often follows Metcalfe's Law (proportional to square of users)
- **Competitive Advantage**: Strong network effects create barriers to entry

This tag should be used when discussing:
- Platform economics and digital marketplaces
- Social networks and communication systems
- Standards adoption and ecosystem development
- Co-goods systems that benefit from network participation

## Notes
Network effects are fundamental to understanding how co-goods might achieve scale and sustainability. Unlike traditional goods, networked co-goods can create value that increases with participation rather than diminishing with competition.
