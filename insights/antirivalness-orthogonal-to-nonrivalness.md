summary: Antirivalness and nonrivalness are two separate dimensions, not stages on a continuum. This distinction is crucial for understanding how collective goods create value.

  - Nonrivalness describes whether sharing depletes the good itself
  - Antirivalness describes whether the system of sharing generates increasing returns
  - A good can be nonrival without being antirival (e.g., a static PDF)
  - Some antirival systems contain rival components (e.g., traffic light networks)
implications:
  - Simply making something 'open' doesn't automatically create network effects
  - System architecture determines whether sharing generates increasing returns
  - Both dimensions must be addressed for full inclusiveness

  - How do we measure the degree of antirivalness in a system?
  - What design patterns maximize both nonrivalness and antirivalness?

# Antirivalness is orthogonal to nonrivalness

## Context

Many economists treat antirival goods as simply "more nonrival," but this misses a crucial distinction that [[f-xavier-olleros|F. Xavier Olleros]] identified in his [[olleros-antirival-goods-2018|2018 paper]]. Understanding these as separate dimensions rather than a continuum fundamentally changes how we approach designing [[commons]] and [[network-effects|network effects]] systems.

## Analysis

[[f-xavier-olleros|Olleros]] argues that [[nonrival|nonrivalness]] and [[antirival|antirivalness]] operate on orthogonal axes:

**Nonrivalness** is a property of the *units* being shared:
- Can the good be copied or shared without depletion?
- Does one person's consumption reduce availability for others?
- Example: An mp3 file is inherently nonrival - copying it doesn't diminish the original

**Antirivalness** is a property of the *system* enabling sharing:
- Does the sharing mechanism generate increasing returns?
- Does more usage create more value for all participants?
- Example: The Napster platform became more valuable as more people used it

This orthogonality means you can have four quadrants:
1. **Rival and non-antirival**: Traditional physical goods
2. **Nonrival but non-antirival**: A PDF sitting on a server
3. **Rival but antirival**: Traffic light networks (rival physical objects, antirival coordination system)
4. **Nonrival AND antirival**: Wikipedia, open source software with active communities

## Supporting Evidence

From [[olleros-antirival-goods-2018|Olleros (2018)]]:

The traffic light example demonstrates antirivalness without full nonrivalness:
- The physical lights are rival (expensive to install in each city)
- The color code system is strongly antirival (more valuable as more cities adopt it)
- Installing traffic lights remains exclusive to cities that can afford them
- Yet the coordination benefit grows with network adoption

The mp3/Napster example shows nonrivalness requiring antirival systems for impact:
- Mp3 files alone were nonrival but didn't transform the music industry
- Only when embedded in Napster's antirival platform did they enable global music sharing
- The platform provided discovery, collective library building, and network effects
- Nonrivalness enabled low-cost sharing; antirivalness created compelling benefits

## Notes

This distinction is foundational for [[co-goods]] theory. Physical products are inherently rival, but we can create antirival *systems* around them by:
- Opening up designs and knowledge (creating nonrival components)
- Building participation mechanisms (creating antirival dynamics)
- Designing feedback loops that increase value with usage

The key insight: we're not trying to make physical goods nonrival (impossible), but rather maximizing the nonrival/antirival ratio by designing systems where the non-physical components (knowledge, community, feedback) become the primary value drivers.
