# Collective goods require high includability, not merely non-excludability

## Context

Many discussions of [[commons]] and public goods focus on excludability - whether access can be controlled. But [[f-xavier-olleros|Olleros]] makes a crucial distinction: truly successful collective goods aren't just non-excludable, they're highly *includable*. The system must actively welcome and reward participation, not just fail to prevent it.

## Analysis

**Non-Excludability: The Passive Quality**

Non-excludability means access cannot be prevented:
- Radio broadcasts reach everyone in range
- Public parks are open to all
- Published research is available to readers
- This is about the *absence* of barriers

**Includability: The Active Quality**

Includability means the system is *designed for participation*:
- Contribution mechanisms are clear and accessible
- Community norms welcome newcomers
- Reward structures make participation meaningful
- Feedback shows how contributions matter
- This is about the *presence* of enablers

**Key Examples:**

**Low includability despite non-excludability:**
- **Radio broadcasts**: Anyone can listen, but there's no path to contribute
- **Public parks**: Open access, but limited ways to improve or shape them
- **Static websites**: Information is available but participation isn't invited

**High includability combined with non-excludability:**
- **Wikipedia**: Anyone can read (non-excludable) AND anyone can edit with clear guidelines, community support, and visible impact (highly includable)
- **Open source projects**: Code is public (non-excludable) AND contribution processes are documented, mentored, and celebrated (highly includable)
- **TED platform**: Videos are free (non-excludable) AND speakers are actively recruited, audiences engaged, translators welcomed (highly includable)

## Supporting Evidence

From [[olleros-antirival-goods-2018|Olleros (2018)]]:

> "The optimal way to manage a strongly antirival good is inclusiveness, perhaps to the point of subsidizing early users and penalizing deviants."

This suggests several strategies for maximizing includability:

**Subsidizing Early Users:**
- Lower barriers for newcomers
- Provide extra support and resources
- Celebrate and amplify early contributions
- Bootstrap [[network-effects|network effects]] by making initial participation rewarding

**Active Design for Participation:**
- Clear pathways from consumption to contribution
- Multiple levels of engagement (not just "all in" or "all out")
- Recognition systems that reward diverse contributions
- Community norms that welcome questions and learning

**Penalizing Deviants:**
- Not excluding people, but enforcing quality and community standards
- Reputation systems that make bad-faith participation costly
- Moderation that protects the inclusive environment
- Balance between openness and maintaining culture

## Notes

**Critical distinction for [[co-goods]]:**

Simply open-sourcing designs (non-excludable) isn't enough. We must actively design for includability:

**Low-barrier entry:**
- Multiple ways to participate (design, feedback, purchasing, usage reporting)
- Clear documentation and learning resources
- Welcoming community culture
- Success stories that show impact of participation

**Meaningful engagement:**
- Visible connection between contribution and outcomes
- Recognition systems (XP, levels, reputation)
- Community events and shared rituals
- Tangible benefits from participation (discounts, early access, influence)

**Progressive engagement:**
- Start with easy contributions (wear the garment, report problems)
- Gradually enable deeper participation (suggest improvements, vote on designs)
- Ultimate contributions (create new designs, mentor newcomers)
- No gatekeeping, but natural progression through contribution

**The goal:** Create systems where people *want* to participate, not just systems where they *can* participate.

**Design question:** At each stage of the user journey, ask:
- "How do we make this more inclusive?" (not just "How do we make this accessible?")
- "What would make someone feel welcomed to contribute?" (not just "Can they technically contribute?")
- "How do we reward this participation?" (not just "Do we allow it?")
