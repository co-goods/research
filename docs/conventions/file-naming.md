# File naming and slugs

How content files are named in the repo, how slugs are formed, and where serials apply.

## File naming

**Flat `.md` files everywhere**, with the filename matching the slug. Two exceptions:

- **Reports**: folder-per-version structure — `research/reports/<type>/<slug>/<version>/<slug>.md` (e.g. `research/reports/lightpapers/co-goods-overview/v0.1/co-goods-overview.md`).
- **Blog**: year/month organisation — `blog/<year>/<month>/<slug>.md` for human file-tree navigation. The URL flattens to `/blog/<slug>`.

No `SOURCE.md` / `AUTHOR.md` / `REPORT.md` generic-inside-folder naming. The filename always carries the slug.

## Slug rules

- **Kebab-case, lowercase, hyphen-separated.** No underscores.
- The `slug:` frontmatter field is always the **bare form** — never includes serials or other prefixes.
- Keep slugs short and stable. Don't rename slugs once content has been published — it breaks links and URL stability.

### Per-collection slug conventions

| Collection | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Library (books, papers, articles, posts, videos, courses) | `<lastname>-<2–3 headline words>` | `olleros-antirival-goods`, `smith-network-coordination-2022` |
| Library (podcasts, podcast-episodes) | `<show-slug>` for podcasts; `<show-slug>-<episode-keywords>` for episodes | `the-knowledge-project`, `the-knowledge-project-shane-parrish-on-learning` |
| Publishers | `<organisation-slug>` | `example-press`, `oxford-university-press` |
| Publications | `<publication-slug>` | `nature`, `the-atlantic`, `the-knowledge-project` |
| People | `<firstname-lastname>` | `jane-doe`, `f-xavier-olleros` |
| Glossary items | Base form canonical | `co-goods` (not `co-goodsing`); grammatical variants live under `classes[type=verb].forms` per the dictionary schema |
| Tags | Single bare term | `antirival`, `network-effects` |
| Essays, wiki articles, insights, observations, hypotheses | Descriptive short slug | `on-collaboration`, `network-coordination`, `asynchronous-coordination-density` |
| Blog posts | Descriptive short slug | `welcome-to-the-blog` |
| Doc articles | Descriptive short slug | `slug-rules`, `required-fields` |

## Serials

Some library items get a **serial** in YAML frontmatter (never in the filename or folder name):

| Prefix | Used by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `l-#####` | **Library items only** (books, papers, podcasts, etc.) | Every library item in the repo gets one. Rule: **in repo = has a serial.** Items kept externally but not promoted into the repo have no serial. |
| `x-#####` | **Example library items only** | Placeholder content used to exercise the website's library templates without claiming research-domain status. Keeps `l-00001+` reserved for the first curated library entries. |

Other content types (people, tags, insights, observations, hypotheses, wiki, essays, reports, glossary, blog posts, docs) do **not** use serials.

`resources/library/INDEX.md` is the registry of assigned serials.

## Why no `nn-` prefix on doc filenames

Doc articles used to use numeric prefixes (`01-taxonomy.md`, `02-frontmatter.md`) for sort order. That has been retired — renaming files to reorder them broke URLs and links.

Instead, ordering lives in YAML:

```yaml
order: 20
```

Filenames are slugs only; the `order:` field on each doc article sorts siblings within a collection (or sub-collection). Numbers in tens (10, 20, 30) leave room to insert without renumbering. See `taxonomy.md` and `frontmatter.md` for the doc article template.

## Asset files

Images and other media that are **part of the content** (diagrams, figures, charts, book covers) live in an `assets/` folder next to the item that uses them, and are referenced with a local-style path:

```
resources/wiki/network-coordination.md
resources/wiki/assets/coordination-diagram.svg   →  ![](./assets/coordination-diagram.svg)
```

Asset filenames follow the same slug rules as everything else: **kebab-case, lowercase, hyphen-separated**, descriptive and stable. Keep the extension (`.svg`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.mp4`). Don't rename an asset once content references it — it breaks the reference.

- **Reports** keep their per-version `assets/` folders with cascading lookup — a version's `assets/` holds only what changed in that version. (Unchanged here.)
- **Presentation imagery** (hero backgrounds, decorative site images) is *not* a content asset — it lives in the website repo's `public/`, not in a content `assets/` folder. See `media.md` for the content-vs-presentation split.

## Related conventions

- **Taxonomy** (collections, items, templates): see `taxonomy.md`.
- **Frontmatter contract** (universal + per-template fields): see `frontmatter.md`.
- **Templates and versioning** (semver, archive workflow): see `templates-and-versioning.md`.
- **Wikilinks** (qualified-path syntax): see `wikilinks.md`.
- **Images and video** (media blocks, asset location): see `media.md`.
