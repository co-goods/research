# Library Index

Metadata for items in the Co-Goods library. Serials are assigned on entry to the repo — every library item has one (`in repo = has a serial`). The full record is in each item's `.md` file; this index is the at-a-glance view.

## Items

| Serial | Title | Slug | Type | Authors | Year | Cited | Featured | Added by | Added |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

_(No curated library items yet. The first curated item will receive serial `l-00001`.)_

## Example items

Dummy content used to exercise website templates. Serials use the `x-#####` namespace so the curated `l-#####` numbering remains untouched. Items here all carry `example: true` in their frontmatter and can be bulk-filtered or removed.

| Serial | Title | Slug | Type | Authors | Year | Cited | Featured | Added by | Added |

| x-00002 | Systems Thinking for the Curious | johnson-systems-thinking-2019 | book | [[people/jane-doe\|Jane Doe]] | 2019 | ✓ |   | [[people/pontus-karlsson\|Pontus Karlsson]] | 2026-05-21 |
