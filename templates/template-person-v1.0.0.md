<!--
Person schema (template: person, v1.0.0).

Required:
- File location: `people/<slug>.md` (flat)
- `slug`: `firstname-lastname` (e.g. `f-xavier-olleros`, `pontus-karlsson`)
- `name`: display name
- `affiliation`: enum — `co-goods-team | depalma-pilot | external-author | unclaimed`
- `bio`: brief biography

Optional (add when relevant):
- `institution`: free-text employer / academic institution
- `expertise`, `aliases`, `key_publications`, `tags`, `sources_by_author[]`
- `account-status`: for the future Clerk/Supabase "claim profile" integration
- `relevance_to_project`

Person profiles aggregate the ways someone shows up across the repo. Roles
(`authors:`, `contributors:`, `editors:`, `designers:`, `reviewers:`) are
expressed on the content that references the person, not on the profile itself.
