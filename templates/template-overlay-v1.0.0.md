<!--
Overlay schema (template: overlay, v1.0.0).

Splice fragments that layer site-specific framing onto a source page
without the source content knowing about it. Lives in
`website/overlays/<source-folder>/<slug>.md` in the website repo (not the
content repo). The path mirrors the source's content path — e.g. an
overlay for `thinking/essays/on-collaboration.md` lives at
`website/overlays/thinking/essays/on-collaboration.md`.

Frontmatter is minimal: optional title and note for human reference. No
`collection:` — overlays aren't items in a collection.

Body: one or more fenced section blocks. Each block is one spliced
section; its splice metadata rides as reserved props:

- `region`: `top | body | sidebar | bottom` (default `body`).
- `position`: `top | bottom | { before: <anchor> } | { after: <anchor> }`.
  Anchor `default` refers to the layout's own content (the markdown body
  in `body`).
- `name` (optional): an anchor other sections can target.

Reserved props are stripped before the block's normal props reach its
component.
