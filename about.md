# About Co-Goods

Research into protocols and tokens for co-created and networked physical products

## Project Overview

The co-goods project explores the intersection of cooperative economics, digital protocols, and physical product creation. We're investigating how networked physical goods can exhibit antirival characteristics and create positive externalities through shared creation and use.

Our research draws from economic theory, protocol design, and real-world case studies to develop frameworks for understanding and implementing co-created goods at scale.

## Research Focus

### Antirival Goods Theory
Understanding how physical goods can exhibit increasing returns to shared use and network effects similar to digital platforms.

### Protocol Design
Developing frameworks for coordinating cooperative creation, ownership, and value distribution in networked physical goods.

### Economic Models
Exploring new economic models for shared ownership, cooperative production, and value capture in physical goods networks.

### Case Studies
Analyzing real-world examples of cooperative production, commons-based manufacturing, and networked physical goods.

## Methodology

Our research combines theoretical analysis with empirical investigation. We systematically collect and analyze academic sources, real-world case studies, and theoretical frameworks to build a comprehensive understanding of co-goods systems.

This research database serves as both a working tool for our investigation and a resource for others interested in cooperative economics and networked physical goods.

## Contact

This research is led by Pontus Karlsson and supported by contributors from various disciplines including economics, computer science, and cooperative studies.
